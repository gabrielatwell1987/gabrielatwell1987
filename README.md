## About Me

I am a frontend developer that has built many projects for fun. I really enjoy CSS and animation on the web.. especially GSAP. Some say that I'm a visual person. I've also been getting into three.js, to make awesome 3d animations. Don't be shy if you have a question or problem, I'll help you if I can.

## Main Goal
My main goal is really simple.. to become an aspiring frontend developer. I like building things that people can see and touch. Most people call this User Interface(UI) design and I've been studying this immensely. I have also been studying User Experience(UX) design as well. I enjoy learning as well.. I've been teaching myself the backend of development for a hobby but frontend is where I'm very comfortable.
