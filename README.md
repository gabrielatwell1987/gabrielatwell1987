## Main Goal
My main goal is really simple.. to become an aspiring frontend developer. I like building things that people can see and touch. Most people call this User Interface(UI) design and I've been studying this immensely. I have also been studying User Experience(UX) design as well. I enjoy learning as well.. I've been teaching myself the backend of development for a hobby.
