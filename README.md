# My name is Gabe ðŸ¤–

I am a frontend developer that has built many projects for fun. I really enjoy CSS and Greensock because it is what I'm very good at. I've also been getting into three.js. Don't be shy if you have a question or problem, I'll help you if I can.

This is what I'm proficient in:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GSAP

And soon to be proficient in:
- Three.js

Please contact me if you need a frontend dev!
